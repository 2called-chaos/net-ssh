DOCUMENT the Net::SSH::Test system

set up a custom mapping for log levels, since the Logger level constants don't make sense here

tweak the logger output so it isn't so noisy

find a way to allow log output to be filtered...?

find a nice way to allow server/client algorithms to be specified independently (e.g., compress from client->server, but not vice-versa).

examples

net-ssh-config
