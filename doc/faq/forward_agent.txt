To forward an SSH agent connection (so that ssh connections from the remote host can use the SSH agent connection on your local host), just specify the @:forward_agent@ option when you start the connection:

<h:code lang="ruby">
require 'net/ssh'

Net::SSH.start("host.com", "bob", :forward_agent => true) do |ssh|
  # ...
end
</h:code>

When you specify that option, the forwarded agent connection will be established the first time a session channel is opened (explicitly or implicitly). The forwarded agent will remain active (and available to subsequent channels) until the connection itself is terminated.

Use caution when enabling agent forwarding, since it does open up a vector for attackers to (e.g.) authenticate themselves using your agent, if they can manage to bypass file permissions on the remote host and gain access to the agent's Unix-domain socket.
