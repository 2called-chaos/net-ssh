To use a specific public key to log in, just specify the path to that file with the @:keys@ option (without the ".pub" suffix):

<h:code lang="ruby">
require 'net/ssh'

Net::SSH.start("host.com", "bob", :keys => "/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa") do |ssh|
  # ...
end
</h:code>

If you have multiple keys that you want to be considered (i.e., you don't know beforehand which will work, but you suspect one of them might), just pass an array of filenames:

<h:code lang="ruby">
require 'net/ssh'

keys = %w(/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa
          /home/bob/.ssh/id_dsa)

Net::SSH.start("host.com", "bob", :keys => keys) do |ssh|
  # ...
end
</h:code>

If any of the keys are encrypted, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase.
