The default port assigned for the SSH protocol is 22. If you want to connect to a different port (perhaps because you're connecting over a forwarded port), you can specify the port number as an option:

<h:code lang="ruby">
require 'net/ssh'

Net::SSH.start("host.com", "bob", :port => 4567) do |ssh|
  # ...
end
</h:code>
